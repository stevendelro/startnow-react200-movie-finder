## An OMDB search app built with React/Redux/React-Router
This is a search app that utilizes the OMDB API to find a list of movies by title, then details by movie when you select a movie. 

As it stands right now, the OMDB API isn't optimized for https. 

* With https calls, 1-in-3 requests have response failures.
* With http calls, everything pretty much works as intended.

If you have problems getting it to load, check the URL and make sure it's http not https.
