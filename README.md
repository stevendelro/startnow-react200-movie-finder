## An OMDB search app built with React/Redux/React-Router
A search app that utilizes the OMDB API to find a list of movies by title and details by movie. 

### [DEMO](http://sd-movie-finder.herokuapp.com)

Made to be used with http instead of https. The OMDB API as it is right now isn't optimized for https. 1-in-3 requests fail with https API calls and nearly none fail with http.
